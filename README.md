# ANDROID GET LOCATION #

People seem to overcomplicate how to get Android's Current/Last Known Location, so heres how.

### Details ###

* Uses Android Studio
* Clone and run
* Sorry I copied the whole package and all the rubbish, just to make it seemingly easy but probably more difficult.
* Code is very simple, you can find details here - https://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current.html#last-known

### Whats not in the Main Activity file that I need? ###

* [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/oscarmeanwell/Android-Location/blob/master/mySensors/app/src/main/java/com/example/a40201136/mysensors/MainActivity.java)
* Add this line to dependencies in the build.gradle compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:11.0.0'

### Who do I talk to? ###
